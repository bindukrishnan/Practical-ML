## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
library(caret)
pml<-read.csv("C:/Users/Bindu/Desktop/pml-training.csv")
View(pml)
# create a list of 80% of the rows in the original dataset we can use for training
validation_index <- createDataPartition(pml$num_window, p=0.80, list=FALSE)
# select 20% of the data for validation
validation <- pml[-validation_index,]
# use the remaining 80% of data to training and testing the models
pml <- pml[validation_index,]
dim(pml)
summary(pml)
library(psych)
describe(pml)
sapply(pml,class)
head(pml)
# summarize the class distribution
percentage <- prop.table(table(pml$num_window)) * 100
cbind(freq=table(pml$num_window), percentage=percentage)

# Run algorithms using 10-fold cross validation
control <- trainControl(method="cv", number=10)
metric <- "Accuracy"

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
